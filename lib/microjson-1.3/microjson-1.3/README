			microjson README

microjson parses the largest possible subset of JSON that can be
unpacked directly into static C structures, without using malloc(3).

microjson is very small and very low-footprint, intended for use in
constrained embedded environments.  It may also be of interest for
code where malloc is verboten to reduce reliability and sexurity 
vulnerabilities.

There's no man page, but there's a tutorial with examples in
microjson.asc.
